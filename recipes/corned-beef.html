        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
            <li>10 small red potatoes</li>
            <li>5 carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large head cabbage, cut into small wedges</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place corned beef in large pot or Dutch oven and cover with water. Add the spice packet that came with the corned beef. Cover pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer approximately 50 minutes per pound or until tender.</li>
            <li>Add whole potatoes and carrots, and cook until the vegetables are almost tender. Add cabbage and cook for 15 more minutes. Remove meat and let rest 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place vegetables in a bowl and cover. Add as much broth (cooking liquid reserved in the Dutch oven or large pot) as you want. Slice meat across the grain.</li>
        </ol>
